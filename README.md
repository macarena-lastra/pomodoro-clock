# Pomodoro Clock

Hey! This is a little app to help any programmer (or just a person who is working really hard) to work in a helthier way, taking a break here and there from time to time.

## How it works?

Just set the length for your break and sessions and play the timer. 5:25 is the classic break:session ratio of the pomodoro method but you can set them the time you want.

## Some comments

I made this with great help from [this Landon Schlangen tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8khA0nJzh8A). *Check his [Github profile](https://github.com/Landon345)*

The music I used for the alarms are fragments of "Rasputin" from Boney M. and "The Anvil of Crom" from Conan The Barbarian's soundtrack. I may eventually change them.
